This is description about the give code.

The give code cover various Object oriented concepts of java some are as follows : 
	
	1.Encapsulation : In encapsulation we bind the data(variables) and methods(functions) together as a single unit.
		By using concept of class we achieve encapsulation.
		In the given program we achieve encapsulation by creating classes such as Person, Employee and OOPS. 
	
	2.Inheritance : It is an ability of program, such that one class can acquire the properties of the other class.
		In given code the class Employee acquire the properties of class Person by the use of inheritance (single inheritance),
		where the Person class act as a super class and Employee class act as a sub-class.

	3.Polymorphism : The ablity of program to take more than one form is called as polymorphism.
		there are two types of polymorphism 
			i)Compile time polymorphism : In it decision is taken by compiler at compile time.
				one example of compile time polymorphism is method overloading.
				In given code the 'set' method is overloaded it has two form which are as follow : 
					1) void set()
					2) void set(String name, int  age, String address)
			ii)Runtime polymorphism : In it decision is taken by compiler at run time.
				one example of runtime polymorphism is method overwriting.
				In given code the 'set' and 'show' methods are overwritten by the methods of class Employee,
				also superclass variable 'runTime' can contain an instance of a subclass.
	4.Abstraction : It means to hide unnecessary details of program from user.
	
Advantages of OOPS : 
	1. Increase the reusability of code.
	2. It closely related with real world entities so software developement is become easier.
	3. It makes software easier to maintain.

Disadvantages of OOPS : 
	1. Large program.
	2. It Requried skill and planning to work.
